I'm a PhD student with the NYU Center for Data Science. My research interests center around cognitively-inspired machine learning: how can we draw inspiration from human cognition to advance the design of machine learning methods. I'm also interested in the more human-like learning that happens when we expose a model to multiple tasks -- continual learning and metalearning. 

When I am not in the lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, cooking various meat dishes, and reading (primarily fantasy, sci-fi, and nonfiction).
