abstract: "Previous work has shown that cognitive models incorporating passive decay of the values of unchosen features explained choice data from a human representation learning task better than competing models (Niv et al. 2015). More recently, models that assume attention-weighted reinforcement learning were shown to predict the data equally well on average (Leong, Radulescu et al. 2017). We investigate whether the two models, which suggest different mechanisms for implementing representation learning, explain the same aspect of the data, or different, complementary aspects. We show that combining the two models improves the overall average fit, suggesting that these two mechanisms explain separate components of variance in participant choices. Employing a trial-by-trial analysis of differences in choice likelihood, we show that each model helps explain different trials depending on the progress a participant has made in learning the task. We find that attention-weighted learning predicts choice substantially better in trials immediately following the point at which the participant has successfully learned the task, while passive decay better accounts for choices in trials further into the future relative to the point of learning. We discuss this finding in the context of a transition at the ``point of learning'' between explore and exploit modes, which the decay model fails to identify, while the attention-weighted model successfully captures despite not explicitly modeling it."
